# The Goal
Let's implement a mine "simulator". The mine is designed like a chess board. On random fields are gold nugets placed.

One dwarf is moving over the "board" and if he finds gold he put it in his pocket.

# Requirements
* Python
* an editor (e.g. vscode)

# Improvements compared to 01
* the mine get filled with random gold spots
